-- In this SQL, I'm querying a database with multiple tables in it to quantify statistics about customer and order data. 

#1. How many orders were placed in January? 
SELECT COUNT(orderID)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE length(orderID) = 6
AND 'orderID' <> "Order ID"; 

#2. How many of those orders were for an iPhone?
SELECT COUNT(orderID)
FROM BIT_DB.Jansales
WHERE length(orderID) = 6
AND 'orderID' <> "Order ID"
AND Product = "iPhone";

#3. Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February.
SELECT distinct acctnum
FROM BIT_DB.customers c
INNER JOIN BIT_DB.FebSales f
ON c.order_id = f.orderID
WHERE length(orderID) = 6
AND 'orderID' <> "Order ID";

#4. Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price?
SELECT distinct product, price
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE length(orderID) = 6
AND 'orderID' <> "Order ID"
ORDER BY price ASC LIMIT 1;

#5. What is the total revenue for each product sold in January?
SELECT product, SUM(quantity)*price AS revenue
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE length(orderID) = 6
AND 'orderID' <> "Order ID"
GROUP BY product;

#6. Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue?
SELECT product, sum(Quantity)*price AS revenue, Quantity
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
WHERE length(orderID) = 6
AND 'orderID' <> "Order ID"
AND location = "548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101"
GROUP BY product;

#7. How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time, and what was the average amount spent for those customers? 
SELECT count(distinct c.acctnum), product, AVG(Quantity*price) AS revenue
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales F
LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.customers c
ON c.order_id = f.orderID
WHERE f.quantity > 2
AND length(orderID) = 6
AND 'orderID' <> "Order ID";

#7 List all the products sold in Los Angeles in February, and include how many of each were sold. 
SELECT Product, SUM(Quantity)
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
WHERE location like '%Los Angeles%'
GROUP BY Product;
